# React Simple Meals App

This simple meals react app was built from https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code O'Reilly video courses - chapter 11.

I had access to [these files](https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/tree/11-practice-food-order-app/extra-files)
and built the app starting [from this scratch template](https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/tree/11-practice-food-order-app/code/01-starting-project).

This simple app continues to be updated in chapter 17.
